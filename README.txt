Cat Spotter App.

app is functionally complete (i think). still, improvements can be made in places:
- more modularization of subviews can be done

- be sure on whether a variable should be @state, @binding, and normal. (i think theres just one place where im unsure)

- clean up comments and add comments where there are none

- interactions
    - when tapping map to add cat, should clear addcat form info
    - some print statements can be app notifications
    - interactions with user input should be sanitized (basically just make sure they have inputted something)
    
- fix scaling issues with images

- UI improvements (can be obvious when you test app on physical phone)
